# Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms

So! Yes! Here we are again. We have already learned a little bit about the basics and a little bit more about OOP in Python. But now comes the interesting part... chan chan chaaaaaaaaaaaaannnn and the reason why we are still triggered with the concept of programming: Data Structures and Algorithms.

Once upon a time there was a girl who knew how to play a little bit with code. 4th semester, I guess. Not great expectations in this new subject but suddenly everything changed for her. The magic of creating with simple concepts. Nodes, graphs, connections. Simple functions that created a whole universe of solutions to solve a single problem. The power of simplicity. The power of understanding. The power of programming. A sheet of paper, a pencil and her mind dancing around with ideas that jumped in her head til the eureka moment comes! Yes. Definitely one of the greatest feelings ever. 

This is the beginning of a new journey that tries to return to that state of flow where everything seemed to be challenging but at the same time so exciting that it felt like a constant game and dance. However, as Heraclitus once said: “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”, this is a new beginning to reinvent ourselves. Discover new patterns and experience new sensations. Sensations? Really? Yep... It may sounds kinda strange but every time that I learn sth related with creating, specially when it comes to solve problems with creativity, pencil, sheet of paper and my mind, I feel such a river of sensations that I can't stop. 

This is the chapter where we begin to learn again about the way we can create solutions and understand problems. This is the chapter where we begin to learn again about data structures and algorithms.
